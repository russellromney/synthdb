do not worry about backward compatibility. rather, make the changes that make the most sense given the instructions. the user will make commits as necessary to ensure the previous code is retrievable. this means you don't have to create new demos or new tests to test new functionality, rather just replace the old demo/example/tests when existing functionality is outdated after changes. 

always update tests, documentation, and examples to reflect changes to the ergonomics and functionality of the code. 

never make any changes to the "tasks" file in the root directory.
