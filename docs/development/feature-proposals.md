# Feature Proposals

This section contains detailed proposals for new features and enhancements to SynthDB. Each proposal includes motivation, design details, implementation plans, and considerations for future development.

## Current Proposals

### Database Branching
<div class="status-badge status-proposed">Proposed</div>

**[Database Branching](feature-proposals/database-branching.md)**

Add branching capabilities to SynthDB, allowing users to create isolated copies of database files, perform operations on them, and optionally merge changes back to the main database.

**Key Features:**
- Create isolated database branches for safe experimentation
- Merge changes back to main database with conflict resolution
- Support for different branching strategies (copy, copy-on-write, read-only)
- Git-like workflow for database operations

**Complexity:** High | **Timeline:** 9-13 weeks

### Joined Table Queries
<div class="status-badge status-proposed">Proposed</div>

**[Joined Table Queries](feature-proposals/joined-table-queries.md)**

Add support for joining multiple tables in SynthDB queries, enabling relational queries across the flexible schema-on-write architecture.

**Key Features:**
- Inner, left, right, and outer joins
- Automatic relationship detection and predefined joins
- Join builder pattern for complex queries
- Integration with SynthDB's EAV model

**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeline:** 8-12 weeks

---

### Safe User Query Execution
<div class="status-badge status-proposed">Proposed</div>

**[Safe User Query Execution](feature-proposals/safe-user-queries.md)**

Add the ability for users to execute custom SQL queries with built-in safety mechanisms that prevent modification of database structure or access to internal tables.

**Key Features:**
- SQL parsing and validation for safety
- Read-only query execution with security controls
- Advanced analytics capabilities (window functions, CTEs)
- Integration with reporting tools and BI systems

**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeline:** 10-14 weeks

---

### Column References and Aliasing
<div class="status-badge status-proposed">Proposed</div>

**[Column References and Aliasing](feature-proposals/column-references.md)**

Add support for column references that allow multiple column definitions to point to the same underlying data without duplicating storage. Enables efficient schema evolution, data migration, and column aliasing.

**Key Features:**
- Hard, soft, and alias reference modes for different use cases
- Copy-on-write behavior for flexible data independence
- Storage-efficient schema evolution and migration support
- Backward compatibility during column renaming

**Complexity:** Medium | **Timeline:** 8-12 weeks

## Proposal Process

### Submitting a Proposal

### Evaluation Criteria

Proposals are evaluated based on:

1. **User Value**: Does this solve real user problems?
2. **Technical Feasibility**: Can this be implemented with reasonable effort?
3. **Architectural Fit**: Does this align with SynthDB's design principles?
4. **Maintenance Burden**: What's the long-term maintenance cost?
5. **Breaking Changes**: Does this require breaking changes to existing APIs?
6. **Performance Impact**: How does this affect system performance?

## Implementation Priorities
