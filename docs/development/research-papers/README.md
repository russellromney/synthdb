# SynthDB Research Papers

This directory contains in-depth research and analysis papers on various aspects of SynthDB's architecture, performance, and design decisions.

## Purpose

Research papers differ from feature proposals in that they:
- Focus on empirical analysis and measurement
- Provide data-driven insights
- Explore theoretical boundaries and limitations
- Compare different approaches with benchmarks
- Document experimental findings

## Format

Each research paper follows an academic-style structure:

1. **Abstract** - Brief summary of findings
2. **Introduction** - Background and research questions
3. **Methodology** - How the research was conducted
4. **Results** - Data and findings
5. **Analysis** - Interpretation of results
6. **Conclusions** - Key takeaways and recommendations
7. **References** - Sources and related work
8. **Appendices** - Code, scripts, and additional data

## Current Research Papers

### [Performance Scaling Analysis](performance-scaling-analysis.md)
Investigates how SynthDB performance changes as databases grow from megabytes to multi-gigabyte scale. Includes benchmarks, bottleneck analysis, and optimization strategies.

## Proposed Future Research

1. **Concurrency and Transaction Performance**
   - Multi-writer performance characteristics
   - Transaction isolation level impacts
   - Deadlock prevention strategies

2. **Vector Storage Optimization**
   - Embedding storage strategies
   - Similarity search performance
   - Index structure comparisons

3. **Schema Evolution Patterns**
   - Common schema change patterns in production
   - Performance impact of schema flexibility
   - Optimization for specific evolution patterns

4. **Distributed SynthDB Architecture**
   - Sharding strategies for horizontal scaling
   - Consistency models for distributed deployment
   - Performance characteristics across regions

5. **Memory Usage Patterns**
   - Cache efficiency analysis
   - Memory footprint optimization
   - Working set size calculations

## Contributing

To add a new research paper:

1. Create a new markdown file following the naming pattern: `{topic}-analysis.md`
2. Use the academic structure outlined above
3. Include reproducible benchmarks and code
4. Provide raw data where applicable
5. Update this README with a summary

## Guidelines

- Focus on measurable, reproducible results
- Include benchmark code in appendices
- Use charts and graphs where helpful
- Compare against relevant baselines
- Be objective about limitations
- Suggest actionable improvements
